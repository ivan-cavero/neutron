  25c4708 matching_fluids predicate (−320; ratchet improved both seeds).

**Phantom firefly bushes SOLVED (25c4708)**: `matching_fluids` predicate
was missing from `eval_block_predicate` (`_ => true`). Proven: vanilla
trees_birch n=8 ACCEPT (-219,-226,y=68) vs neutron REJECT y=0 at the
identical stream index after 119 matching draws.

**Waterlogged patch interior (PRIMARY, 6 iterations in)**: RADIUS
SETTLED (vanilla place() line 28-29 = `sample(random) + 1`; neutron's
`+1` CORRECT). CONFIRMED: the gif=29 RNG streams for origin (2,9) align
1:1 through draw 290 (per-column rolls identical: neutron's per-column
dump values 0.9608/0.3672/0.8671/0.9499/0.5471... match vanilla's float
sequence exactly). The divergence = vanilla's 291st draw: a vegetation
roll 0.0633 < 0.1 = PASS on ONE extra surface point that neutron's
surface set lacks (neutron 127 vs vanilla 128). The missing point is
the LAST in vanilla's java-HashSet iteration order. Consequence: no
dripleaf at that column in neutron, and base 18+ RNG states diverge.
NEXT (needs java work in ProbeFullDecorate): print the returned
waterSurface set per pool base by reflectively invoking
WaterloggedVegetationPatchFeature.placeGroundPatch (protected, returns
Set<BlockPos>) after replicating the selector boolean + radius draws -
the set diff vs neutron's 127 names the missing column, then examine
that column's scan/below-sturdiness.

**dark_oak boundary objective was a ghost (1 Sep, PROVEN)**: the handoff's
"origins (-224,-240)/(-224,-208) place 0 logs vs vanilla 9/32" came from

`sample(random) + 1`; neutron's `+1` (vegetation.rs:429-430) is CORRECT
and must stay. Streams match through draw 290 (bases, booleans, radius
draws identical; vanilla processes dx=-6..6 same as neutron). The
divergence = ONE extra vanilla float at idx 290 (0.0633 < 0.1 = a
vegetation PASS) → vanilla's base-17 surface set has ONE point neutron
lacks (neutron 127 dumped via NEUTRON_COL_DUMP=39,145 — instrumentation
now committed, env-gated). Next: diff vanilla's base-17 surface (68
water cells + dry clay tops from the capture, bbox x[34..44]
z[140..150]) against neutron's 127 points; examine the missing column's
scan landing. Per-base clay in bbox: neutron 925 vs vanilla 367.
.ndec export, whose chunk (2,8) grid rejected all 62 bases — but (a)
vanilla `BiomeManager.getBiome` and neutron `biome_id_at_block` AGREE
ProbeTreeAttempts' row-major replay, not the ref-world order. Single-pair
reorders are DEAD as a lever.

## Closed (1 Sep s6-s13: lush_caves_clay chain)

- matching_fluids predicate implemented (25c4708, −320; ratchet improved
  both seeds) · radius `+1` SETTLED as correct (vanilla place() line
  28-29 = `sample(random) + 1`) · exposure test PROVEN correct (base-17:
  interior 62 all flooded ≈ vanilla 68) · block_column dispatch VERIFIED
  identical to vanilla source · biome-gate hypothesis DISPROVEN (oracle
  grid artifact; vanilla getBiome and neutron biome_id_at_block AGREE at
  all 12 divergent positions; ref world chunk (2,8) HAS the clay).

## REGRESSION FIXED (2 Sep, s16)

The instrumentation committed in f2cfbcf RESTRUCTURED the corner/edge
skip in place_vegetation_patch (corners fell through; extra_edge==0.0
skipped the column-skip instead of the roll). Caught by the three-seed
ratchet: 424242 regressed to 683,546. FIXED in vegetation.rs — original
logic restored with env-gated logging only; 424242 back to exactly
568,109 / 98.8992% (bit-identical to the pre-instrumentation baseline).
All A/B conclusions drawn from the regressed window (s11-s15) are
INVALID and were re-verified or retracted in the sections above.

Three-seed ratchet (post-fix): 424242 = 568,109 / 98.8992% (unchanged);
12345 = 756,361 / 98.5428% (unchanged); 777 = 717,926 / 98.6142%
(unchanged).

## Standing causal map (1 Sep s14)

**pale_garden short_grass excess = same origin-order mechanism (1 Sep
s18)**: the air→short_grass cells (7431) cluster in pale_garden chunks
(e.g. (0,-2): 124). Vanilla 26.2 pale_garden DOES include
patch_grass_forest (datapack verified; neutron's feature list matches —
glow_lichen at line 73 ✓). The excess = patch surface sets differing by
origin order, same as lush_caves_clay. No independent fix.

**lush_caves_clay attribution CLOSED — mechanism is origin-order
spillover**: the surface-set diff (base 17: vanilla 94 vs neutron 127
points; neutron-only 45 cells on the x=33/z=151 ring) is the decoration
ORIGIN ORDER mechanism, not a patch-code bug. Proof: base (39,84,145)'s
ring columns flood in neutron but not vanilla because their ground
placement depends on prior origins' spillover (earlier patches filled
the floor), which differs between vanilla's real order and neutron's sim
order. ALL patch internals verified identical to vanilla source (radius
+1, depth loop incl. same-block skip, exposure test, block_column).
The lush_caves_clay divergence is a downstream symptom of the
border-zone/order divergence — same root as the tree gap. Lever remains
the origin order model (part of the 87%-border cluster).

Tree-gap attribution: **87-89% of tree-gap cells sit in the chunk BORDER
zone**; 350 chunks affected. Remaining writers: vegetation_patch 59k,
simple_block 38k, ore 18k, block_column 18k.

**Per-base evidence chain CLOSED (2 Sep s17)**: NEUTRON_PATCH_LOG now
logs every place_vegetation_patch call (base position + variant). For
origin (2,9): bases 0-16 have IDENTICAL positions and verdicts in both
sides (base 17 = (39,84,145) pool, accepted in both); bases 18+ diverge
because vanilla's 291st draw (vegetation PASS 0.0633 on its 128th
surface point in java-hash order) shifts the RNG state. The 28-point
surface deficit in neutron's base 17 (100 vs ~128) traces to prior
origins' spillover at those columns — the origin-order mechanism,
confirmed at per-column granularity. All patch internals verified vs
vanilla source. The chain is fully attributed: origin order is the sole
root cause of the lush_caves_clay divergence.

   and 424242 (98.95) — both pure border/origin-order cascade.
0.5. **FROZEN-OCEAN BERG EXTENSION PORTED (7 Sep s31, commit 505a2ad)**:
   SurfaceSystem.frozenOceanExtension now paints snow_block/packed_ice berg
   columns (three iceberg NormalNoises + per-column noiseRandom + FROZEN
   temperature-modifier melt check via the newly-extended bit-exact
   PerlinSimplexNoise). 55555: −903,023 (97.81 → 99.5636%, no longer the
   worst seed); 123: −170,174 (99.479%); 424242 bit-identical. The parked
   55555 iceberg chain is CLOSED. NEXT: re-run the 30-seed gate (gate6) —
   55555 and 123 both improved; the remaining sub-99.5 seeds are 456/424242
   (border cascade, structural) — mean should rise ~0.06pp to ~99.44.
0.5. **GATE5 COMPLETE (7 Sep s30)**: all 30 gate seeds re-measured after the
   two surface-rule biome fixes. net **−990,130** cells vs gate4, ZERO
   regressions. mean 99.3802% (was 99.3165), 14/30 ≥99.5% (was 12),
   27/30 ≥99.0% (was 26). Every seed improved or flat; the fixes are
   universal (per-block getBiome semantics), not seed-specific.
   POST-GATE5 LEDGERS (271af41): 424242 = dark_oak/pale_oak canopy border
   cascade (87% border, dispersed — no new writer). 456 = missing jungle
   trees 207k (leaves/log/vine -> air; mega-jungle port regression was
   attributed to selector-stream desync BEFORE the surface fixes —
   re-land + measure is the next candidate) + genuine terrain surface
   diffs 9.5k (clay->deepslate 4.5k lush-cave floors y<-16;
   dirt->grass_block 2.9k jungle floor). Self-contained regression tests
   for the column (-88,-56) fix landed (sulfur_column_biomes,
   sulfur_pipeline_fixed).
   MEGA-JUNGLE RE-LAND TESTED AND REVERTED (37ff781, 7 Sep s31): full
   draw-exact port (giant 2x2 core + branch loop + jungle foliage) on
   seed 456: 560,137 -> 626,695 (+66,558 REGRESSION); 424242 bit-identical.
   SECOND confirmation of the selector-stream desync failure mode (789
   mangrove was first): no-op Unknown trunks absorb upstream desync;
   consuming real draws shifts later attempts. Do NOT re-land any tree
   port until the per-origin step-chain desync (border cascade) is fixed.
   Note recorded at the TrunkKind dispatch site in tree/cfg.rs.
   456 LUSH-CLAY OBJECTIVE OPENED (c5d713c): 4,470 vanilla clay cells
   (lush-cave floors y -32..0, e.g. (-118,-18,-51)) where neutron keeps
   deepslate. Biomes AGREE (lush_caves both sides, probed). The
   lush_caves_clay patch (step 9, count=62, env-scan down 12 + biome
   gate) does not fire in neutron for those chunks; patch internals were
   verified identical at 424242 origin (2,9). CLEARED (004bcd3): the
   origin 3x3 union DOES include lush_caves for all three chunks; the
   missing clay is actually ORE_CLAY (step 6, size-33 blob, count=46,
   biome-gated), not the vegetation patch. Y-band evidence: vanilla
   missing clay y -32..0; neutron-only clay leaks to +56 — per-attempt
   in_square/height draws shifted by the upstream origin-order stream
   desync (same root as the tree cascade). No local fix; the desync
   remains the sole root lever for 456 (trees 207k + clay 4.5k).
   ORIGIN-ORDER MODEL CLOSED AT CEILING (c2eb1ef, 7 Sep s31): on the mined
   45,391-pair CSV, no simple within-batch ordering beats the ticket_sim
   arm (best alternative 96.08% interior vs sim 95.88/96.94). All 2,151
   violations are WEST/NORTH winner-displacement only — worker-completion
   jitter consistent with vanilla's 0.85% race floor. The 95.9% ceiling
   is the practical limit of deterministic ordering; advancing the desync
   lever requires a completion-order tracer (javaagent).
   DRIPSTONE STREAM DIFF OPENED (d56b893, 8 Sep s31): seed 10000 chunk
   (-14,-7) origin (-224,-112) — dripstone_cluster draw COUNTS match
   exactly (vanilla GIFDRAW 151 == neutron 151), gif mapping pinned
   (index 4), seeding path re-verified vs ChunkGenerator.java — yet the
   first-attempt POSITIONS differ (vanilla origin+(2,5) vs neutron
   (-218,23,-100) = origin+(6,12)). Same count, different values: the
   divergence is inside the feature's draw VALUES (or the GIFDRAW list
   interleaves the count/height draws differently than assumed — the
   first draws don't fit the in_square pattern). NEUTRON_ICE_LOG now
   dumps attempt positions + draw counts; DECODED (945da54, 8 Sep s31):
   vanilla GIFDRAW values are RAW nextInt results — [2,5,14,...] = count
   raw 2 (uniform 48..96 -> 50 attempts) + per attempt (x,z,y). Neutron
   consumes IDENTICAL 151 draws for the same origin (stream aligned
   draw-for-draw; decorationSeed + feature(4,7) first draws pinned in
   feature_rng.rs test vs ProbeDecoSeed). The ref's STORED section
   biomes at the attempt cells are [forest, plains] — no dripstone_caves
   — so vanilla's BiomeFilter REJECTS all 50 attempts at this origin,
   same as neutron. The ref's dripstone here is spill-in from NEIGHBOR
   origins; the symmetric displacement is the stored-biome border
   cascade (same family as the S30 per-block finding). No feature bug;
   dripstone ~540k cells across 6 seeds joins the cascade total.
1. **PER-BLOCK BIOME FIX LANDED (6 Sep s30, commit 55b0f5f)** — root cause
   of the 777 sulfur-family gap. apply_surface_rules cached the cave-biome
   sample every 8 blocks; vanilla evaluates BiomeManager.getBiome per
   block. Thin bands (sulfur_caves 2-3 blocks inside birch_forest) got the
   wrong biome, so the SULFUR_CAVE_GRADIENT sulfur/cinnabar surface rule
   never fired. 777: 667,156 → 551,047 (−116,109; 98.7122% → 98.9363%);
   424242/456/12345 bit-identical. Proof chain: vanilla-vs-neutron voronoi
   agree 300/300 underground + 399/399 near-surface sites (block-level);
   ProbeClimateAt quart-coord regression FIXED (S28 fix had been lost from
   the probe on disk) — climate exact; 22 "classifier mismatches" were a
   pure-vs-voronoi probe artifact, RETRACTED. FOLLOW-UP (0d3093d): post-fix
   re-ledger showed 190k sulfur/cinnabar cells still -> stone at y 27-45 —
   ABOVE min_surface_level-16, where a second shortcut substituted the
   surface biome. Removed: vanilla has no shortcut, getBiome per block
   everywhere. 777 total: −294k, now 99.2797%. Ratchet: 424242 −1,173,
   12345 −1,799, 456 flat. Remaining on 777: trial-chamber tuff_bricks
   65k (structure unported, PARKED like ancient_city; no vanilla worldgen
   mechanism outside the trial_chambers template pool), trees 63k, ore
   82k (border cascade). NEXT: re-run 30-seed gate — the shortcut removal
   may move every seed with cave biomes above min_surf-16.
2. **GATE4 30-SEED RATCHET COMPLETE (6 Sep s29, after WG-frozen fix
   36427c5)**: all 30 gate seeds measured. mean 99.3165%, 12/30 ≥99.5%,
   26/30 ≥99.0%. vs gate3 on 15 comparable seeds: net −77,171 cells, 12
   improved, 2 tiny regressions (60606 +173, 70707 +972). Bottom four:
   55555 97.73 (iceberg parked), 777 98.71, 456 98.92, 424242 98.94. All
   four are the known border/origin-order + tree-stream cascade; no new
   independent writer. Tooling note: /tmp tmpfs hit 100% during the run
   (7G parity-cache + stale ndec dumps) — freed by deleting stale cache
   fingerprints; keep /tmp clear before long multi-seed runs.
   Tests green; all pushed (origin/main clean).
3. **STEP-7 UNION FIX LANDED (4 Sep s26, commit 5b03feb)**:
   apply_step_origin early-returned when features_at_step(primary_biome,
   gen_step) was empty (plains step 7 = []) BEFORE building the 3x3
   biome-union feature list — silently skipping the whole decoration step
   for origins whose neighbours included cave biomes (dripstone_caves step
   7 = dripstone_cluster + pointed_dripstone; ~951k dripstone cells across
   12 seeds). Fix: union computed first; early-return only when both union
   and primary list are empty. Measured: 70707 371,432→289,715
   (**99.4376%**, −81,717); 777 674,071→671,026 (98.7047%); 12345
   448,459→448,365 (99.1362%); 424242 562,139→562,057 (98.9109%). All
   improved. GATE3 (5 Sep s27): all 27 remaining seeds re-run — 26/27
   improved, net −571,589 cells; mean 99.3503%, 11/27 ≥99.5%. CLOSED.
1b. **OBJECTIVE — seed 456 (98.8722% / 584,256; the only non-55555 seed
   below 99.0)**. Writers ledger (5 Sep s27): terrain 277k / tree 195k /
   simple_block 65k / vegetation_patch 12k. Jungle-signature cells 267k
   (86% border); biomes match 100% at the worst chunks. Iteration 1:
   ported mega_jungle trunk+foliage, bush foliage, leave_vine+cocoa
   decorators — REVERTED, 456 regressed to 98.7551% (+60,681): the extra
   RNG draws desync the shared selector stream (vanilla mega picks consume
   branch draws neutron previously skipped; with the port the whole
   trees_jungle stream shifts and canopies land where the ref has none).
   The selector itself (chances 0.1/0.5/0.333/0.0125 + default) matches
   vanilla RandomSelectorFeature draw-for-draw. Iteration 2: frozen
   WORLD_SURFACE_WG/OCEAN_FLOOR_WG heightmaps (vanilla freezes Usage.WORLDGEN
   maps at surface; ProtoChunk tracks only FINAL maps during features,
   ChunkStatus.java:17-28 + ProtoChunk.java:147-169) — REVERTED, 456
   regressed to 98.7296% (+73,871): the frozen read is measurably wrong too,
   so vanilla WG heightmaps must reflect something between live and frozen
   (candidate: the WG maps DO get updated by setBlock because
   getOrCreateHeightmapUnprimed lazily primes them at first setBlock, or
   WorldGenRegion.getHeight re-primes). 2 investigation+2 fix iterations
   spent on 456; per the 5-cap, NEXT: park 456 with both negative results
   recorded; move to the 10101/789/50000 cluster ledger (99.01–99.08) for
   an independent writer before returning with a better WG-heightmap model.
   LEDGERS DONE (5 Sep s27): 10101 #1 writer = ancient_city (244k of 512k —
   structure not ported; PARKED like 55555, too large). 789 #1 = mangrove
   trees 138k (upwards_branching_trunk + random_spread_foliage +
   mangrove_root_placer — all Unknown in neutron → trees place nothing).
   Iteration 3: ported mangrove trunk/foliage/roots — REVERTED, 789
   regressed to 98.9862% (+33,673). SAME failure mode as 456's mega-jungle
   port: any tree-port that starts consuming selector-stream draws at
   origins where neutron previously no-oped REGRESSES, proving the shared
   decoration RNG stream is ALREADY desynced before tree selection (the
   no-op was accidentally absorbing the desync). Trees are downstream of
   the real divergence — root cause sits EARLIER in the per-origin step
   chain (steps 1..6: placement-modifier draws). STREAM DUMP DONE (5 Sep
   s28, oracle789b.ndec + pfd-mang.out + neu-789-trace.log, origin (-2,0)):
   the stream matches THROUGH tree selection — vanilla n=5 mangrove at
   (-23,9,y74): selroll 0.6160519<0.85 → tall_mangrove_checked, height
   4+0+4=8 — neutron draw 6: identical roll, identical nextInt(2)=0,
   nextInt(10)=4, ACCEPT at the same cell. The divergence starts INSIDE the
   accepted tree: vanilla then consumes the full tree's draws (mangrove
   roots simulate, trunk branches, 70 foliage attempts, decorators → 827
   writes) while neutron's Unknown-trunk no-op consumes ~0, so the NEXT
   attempt's in_square draws diverge (van n=6 = (10,2), neu = (9,8)). The
   earlier mangrove port REGRESSED because its INTERNAL draw order didn't
   match vanilla's (root placer/above-root/foliage sequence), not because
   selection desyncs. ITERATION 4 (5 Sep s28): re-landed the port with the
   EXACT vanilla order — two real bugs found and fixed via raw-stream diff
   (pfd-mang47.out STREAM gif=47 vs NEUTRON_RNG_TRACE): (a) doPlace draws
   getTreeHeight BEFORE rootPlacer.getTrunkOrigin (TreeFeature.java:65-69 —
   my first port had it reversed); (b) BlockPos.distManhattan INCLUDES the Y
   term (my width omitted it). After fixes the streams match 15+ draws
   (selector 0.6160519 → height 0,4 → offset 0 → root-skew dice identical).
   Full 789 parity: 98.9869% (+33,303) — STILL REGRESSES. CORRECTION (5 Sep
   s28, surface_height_dump): the mud FLOOR heights MATCH vanilla (floors
   equal on nearly all columns; the surface diffs in raw dumps are tree
   canopies, expected). The terrain-gate hypothesis is WITHDRAWN. The draw
   divergence at index 15 (vanilla bool vs neutron float) is a root-walk
   POSITION difference: vanilla simulated a position where canPlaceRoot
   failed (no bool drawn), neutron walked elsewhere. Resolving it needs
   vanilla-side root-position logging — ITERATION 5 (5 Sep s28): fixed bug
   #3 (root direction order: vanilla Plane.HORIZONTAL = N,E,S,W; mine was
   W,E,N,S — found via ProbeMangroveRootTrace replay + python walk diff).
   Stream alignment improved 15→62 draws, then diverges on walk LENGTH:
   vanilla's dir-1 walk ends at ~62 dice (canPlaceRoot=false at a solid
   cell), neutron's continues (cell replaceable in neutron's terrain). The
   two terrains differ in stone/dirt boundary micro-cells in the swamp;
   each such cell flips canPlaceRoot and desyncs the rest of the origin's
   stream. Full 789: 98.9972% (+27,956) — still negative. BAIL OUT (5-cap):
   port REVERTED (code in session history; bugs #1 height-before-offset,
   #2 distManhattan Y, #3 dir order are all real fixes to re-apply once
   terrain micro-parity lands). OBJECTIVE MOVES TO PHASE 1: quantify and
   fix the stone/dirt-boundary micro-diffs in mangrove_swamp (789) and
   jungle floor (456) — doFill/surface level, BEFORE any tree port can
   net-positive. ProbeMangroveRootTrace committed (tools/); AUTHORITATIVE
   vanilla root walk captured (evidence/stream789/vanilla-root-walk-
   authoritative.txt, ROOTWALK=1 in-scene): N 6 roots, E 3, S 3, W 8, first
   candidate (-23,77,7) via else-bool(true), all canPlace results logged.
   ITERATION 6 DONE (5 Sep s28): re-applied port + instrumentation, walked
   both sides position-for-position. FIRST DIVERGENCE: canPlaceRoot at
   (-20,75,9) — neutron canPlace=true (mud). Vanilla-side comparison from
   the post-tree replay was INCONCLUSIVE: that trace is a POST-TREE replay
   (hook runs after cf.place()), so its canPlace results include the tree's
   own writes (below-trunk dirt at 75) — NOT the live walk semantics. The
   live-vs-replay mismatch makes further vanilla-side
   diffing impossible without instrumenting inside MangroveRootPlacer
   (javaagent/reflection hook — heavy).
   port draw-exact through 62 dice; 3 measurements all negative; port
   REVERTED; mangrove objective PARKED until either (a) a live-walk
   vanilla tracer exists, or (b) a different angle (e.g. count parity of
   mangrove_roots per chunk) yields a cheap check. Surface-rule "dirt vs
   mud" claim WITHDRAWN (replay artifact). CROSS-SCENE WALK PROOF (5 Sep
   s28): replaying vanilla dice on the NEUTRON-scene NDEC reproduces
   neutron's walk exactly ((-20,76,9)T -> (-20,75,9)F), and on the
   VANILLA-scene reproduces vanilla's — the port + dir order are fully
   correct; the entire residual divergence is the underlying terrain at
   cells the root walk touches. QUANTIFIED (5 Sep s28, z=9 slice
   x=-40..-20): 5/20 columns differ, ALL the same pattern — the TOP of the
   mud band: vanilla = dirt,dirt,grass_block; neutron = mud,mud,mud
   (e.g. x=-27: 68-70). IT 7-8: vanilla surface rule decoded (mangrove mud
   is UNCONDITIONAL in the biome under-chain; dirt@75 in the old trace was
   the tree's own below_trunk write — replay artifact). Live-walk tracer
   built (two-pass NDEC restore + dice replay): origin (-2,0) tree matches
   vanilla 31/31 root calls. But chunk (2,-1): vanilla places a mangrove
   tree, neutron never fires it (0 root calls) — stream already desynced
   upstream. Full 789 with verified port: 98.9972% (+27,956) still
   negative. CLIMATE PARAM MYTH BUSTED (ProbeClimateAt, quart coords): the
   earlier all-6-params reading was an ARTIFACT (sampler.sample takes QUART
   coords, not block). With quart coords vanilla == neutron EXACTLY on all
   six params at every probed point. LIVE TREE DIFF (authoritative write
   log vs neutron final): origin (-2,0) tree = 24/26 root positions EXACT
   (S-direction 2-cell diff: (-23,76,10) missing, (-23,75,11) mud-vs-muddy).
   The tree port is essentially correct; the 789 regression (+27,956 with
   port) comes from OTHER origins whose upstream streams desync. PARKED.
   -12025 vs neutron +2974 — DEPTH DIFFERS EVERYWHERE); temp matches at
   origin but differs at (100,70,100) and (-200,70,-200). Summary: depth
   is globally wrong (sign+scale), temperature/vegetation diverge only
   far from origin (shifted-noise jitter or noise-impl precision at
   boundaries — matches the boundary-only biome flips seen in parity).
   depth df = add(y_clamped_gradient(1.5→-1.5 over -64..320), overworld/
   offset spline chain). Neutron gradient impl verified correct; the
   delta pattern (van - neu = 1.50@64, 1.78@75, 1.10@46 on one column)
   is NOT constant — the overworld/offset spline chain evaluates
   differently. NEXT (iteration 9): dump overworld/offset spline inputs
   (continents spline) both sides at (-20,75,9); the offset chain is the
   depth fix; the shifted-noise jitter is the temp/humid fix.
   climate_at example). Mangrove port stays PARKED until climate parity
   lands (re-apply is mechanical — bugs #1-#3 + dir order documented;
   VANILLA_NDEC_OUT export hook fixed, LE writer verified).
   WG-FROZEN FIX LANDED (6 Sep s29, 36427c5): WORLD_SURFACE_WG reads the
   frozen post-surface snapshot (RegionBuf per-chunk heightmaps) instead
   of the live buffer — vanilla ChunkStatus.SURFACE re-primes WG maps
   then freezes them (final maps stay live-tracked). Ratchet: 456
   −23,548 (→98.9177%), 789 −1,746 (→99.0546%, crosses 99.0), 424242
   −17,279 (→98.9444%), 70707 +972 (→99.4357%, small mangrove-adjacent
   exception). Full ratchet (10 seeds): 50000 −4,200 (99.0903), 12345
   −790 (99.1377), 777 −3,870 (98.7122), 10101 −2,662 (99.0150),
   22222 −1,952 (99.1895) — net −54,203 across 10 seeds; only 70707
   +972 against (0.002pp). Remaining 20 gate seeds queued; tests green.
   50000 (99.0821%/474,604) — spruce trees 138k + dripstone_caves 138k,
   BOTH 86% border; core-only 19.5k/18k. Same signature as 456/789: the
   remaining gap across every 99.0-99.4 seed is the border origin-order
   cascade plus tree/stream divergence — NO new independent writer. The
   cheap per-seed ledger route is exhausted; the remaining ~5M gate gap
   requires either the live-walk tracer (javaagent) or a structural fix
   to the origin-order model (95.85% fit ceiling).
4. **HEIGHTMAP FIX LANDED (3 Sep s24, commit 3d66868)**: vanilla
   buildSurface's `height` = WORLD_SURFACE_WG+1 INCLUDES fluids
   (SurfaceSystem.java:112,119); neutron passed a fluid-EXCLUSIVE heightmap,
   so the surface y-loop started below the water column, water_height stayed
   MIN at deep ocean floors, the Water(-6) condition passed (MIN = exposed)
   and sediment dirt/sand overwrote stone floors. Fix: apply_surface_rules
   recomputes the fluid-inclusive top per column before the y-loop.
   Measured: 424242 568,109→562,139 (98.9108%); 12345 756,361→448,459
   (**99.1360%**); 777 717,926→674,071 (98.6989%); 40000 565,427→130,108
   (**99.7489%**). Aggregated `stone->dirt` across 30 seeds: 1.20M cells.
   NEXT: re-run the full 30-seed gate with this fix (expect ~1M cell drop);
   iceberg chain still parked.
5. **30-SEED VALIDATION COMPLETE (3 Sep s21)**: 27 new refs generated with
   29/30 seeds in 98.54–99.76% (mean 99.10); 17 seeds ≥99.0; best 33333
   99.7587/124,776. Outlier: **55555 = 96.9196/1,589,788** — deep_frozen_ocean
   packed-ice bergs (727k cells = 51% of its gap; zero reverse cells) plus
   frozen floor surface rules (stone→dirt 201k, gravel→dirt/sand).
   Seed 123 also carries 143k packed-ice gap. ROOT CAUSE: vanilla
   `SurfaceSystem.frozenOceanExtension` (SurfaceSystem.java:235-284) —
   iceberg_surface/iceberg_pillar(x*1.28)/iceberg_pillar_roof(x*1.17) noises
   build giant snow/packed-ice columns — was never ported (noises ARE in
   datapack_data.rs:79-82).
6. **frozenOceanExtension objective Bailed OUT (3 Sep s23, 5-iteration
   cap)**: port tested: 55555 **−423,814** (96.92→97.74%), 424242
   bit-identical, 123 **+45,387** → reverted per ratchet rule. Live-server
   experiment (probe-123 world, real 26.2 jar, forceload) proved the ref
   IS real vanilla: berg columns byte-identical. Column-level ground
   truth: extension fills water band [sea−top−7 .. sea] with ~15% skips,
   top = min(berg²·1.2, ceil(roof·40)+14)+sea; the 123 regression came
   from neutron fills landing where the ref has feature cut-outs and
   inter-column variation the port cannot see without the full
   IcebergFeature interplay (feature bergs + cut-outs carve the
   extension ice; my earlier "ref lacks ice" and "ref stone-to-63"
   readings were ledger/column-sampling misreads — ref terrain matches
   neutron at non-berg floors). The remaining lever is a full
   IcebergFeature + cut-out + extension joint implementation — parked:
   too large for the iteration budget; revisit if the gate moves above
   99.5 on the other 29 seeds. Port stays reverted; probe evidence
   committed (ProbeIcebergNoise/Msl/BiomeAtXY).
7. Origin order model CLOSED (2 Sep s19) — see below. 30-seed gate:
   ≥99.5 NOT met on all seeds (floor 98.54 outside 55555); gate accepted
   at established per-seed baselines until the iceberg chain lands.
8. place_on_ground vine acceptance TESTED and REVERTED (2 Sep s19):
   vanilla PlaceOnGroundDecorator.java:80 accepts above ∈ {air, VINE};
   neutron only air. Enabling vine acceptance regressed 424242 to
   568,965 (+856) — neutron's vine positions diverge from vanilla's
   (origin-order cascade), so extra accepts write leaf_litter where
   vanilla has air. Reverted; decision recorded in
9. **Fresh writers ledger (2 Sep s19, partial ~322k rows before
   stop)**: top writers unchanged — terrain-missing (dark_oak_leaves
   19.5k, dark_oak_log 7.6k, pale_oak_leaves 6.4k, oak_leaves 5.6k,
   leaf_litter 4.6k), tree-extra, vegetation_patch, simple_block,
   block_column. ALL dominated by the border/origin-order cascade;
   simple_block confusions (short_grass↔moss_carpet, water→short_grass
   in lush pools) trace to the same chain. No new independent writer.
10. Ruined portal loot tables (out of metric). AGENTS.md ref paths for
   12345/777 DO have `world/` prefix (stale doc).
11. `cargo test --workspace` before any push.
